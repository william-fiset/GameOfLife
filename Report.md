<!--

1. explain to the reader what the objective of the project is
2. explain what alternative design choices were considered in the construction of the project,
what choices were finally made, and why. This choices range from simple organization of
code into functions, as well as choices of algorithms and data organization.
3. explain how the code has been verified to work. This will include both the tests that were run (in enough detail that the reader could run these again if desired), as well as whether and why you feel that these tests are sufficient to demonstrate correct operation of your
code.
Note that if your submission is incomplete, you can still test it; testing should thereby demonstrate what parts are missing.
At minimum, your report should include each of the following sections:
1. Objectives: Describe the objectives of your tool set
2. Design: In this section, you will explain the design decisions you made in your code,
including those decisions on the ID field, how you will manage deletion, and your addition
data field, as indicated above.
3. Testing Rationale: Provide a set of test cases you have run, and for each, whether your
code passes the test.

##Objective

The end goal of this project was to design a database the can store user information on disk namely, 
the users name, email(s) and phone number(s). 

##Design

The design portion of this assignment was created largely in part by [Dr. Andrew Hamilton-Wright](http://mathcs.mta.ca/faculty/ahamiltonwright.html) which included everything needed to make the program work expect for the Input & Output calls, queryRecords program, dumpEmails program and reading in the phone number information. My task consisted of filling in these gaps. 


##Testing Rationale

###Write Records

###Dump Person Records

###Dump Email Records

``` python

for x in range(0, 100): print "Hello World"


```

###Dump Phone Records

###Query Records Tests
